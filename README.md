# 2FA-Middleware

![Project Logo](doc/images/2fa-logo.png)

2FA-Middleware is a secure authentication middleware for FastAPI applications, integrating Keycloak for user authentication and 2-factor authentication (2FA) via email, Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP), and SMS. It provides a robust and flexible authentication solution for frontend applications. In this project a simple React frontend application will be used to demonistrate this concept.

## Key features:

- Keycloak Integration: Seamlessly integration Keycloak for user management and authentication, leveraging its robust identity and integrate external identity providers.
- 2-Factor Authentication: Implement 2FA using various methods, including email, TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator), and SMS, ensuring an additional layer of security for your application.
- OTP SMS and Email confirmations.

## Architecture

- Keycloak handles authentication and issues JWT tokens.

- FastAPI acts as the central orchestrator, validating tokens and routing requests.

- PostgreSQL stores persistent data like user profiles, transactions, etc.

- Redis manages session data for quick access and scalability.

- SMTP is used by FastAPI to send emails.

- SMS API is triggered by FastAPI to send messages.

## RDBMS Schema

RDBMS schema consists of a single table, user_profile.
